P3: Investigate a Dataset
==========
The main goal of this project is to explore which factors could be associated with survivial rates for the Titanic disaster. I chose to explore correlation between survival rate and each of five factors: passenger class, sex, age category (child or adult), parenting status within grownups (parent or not parent) and marriage status of woman (miss or mrs). This factors was chosen based on the following intuitions:
* Richer people (from higher passenger class) got more chances to survive
* "Women and children first"
* Saved children needed to be accompanied by parent, so adults with children might have a better chance to survived than not parents.
* Married women would have help of their husbands, while unmarried women have no one to care about them
Further analysis in this project checks those intutions as well as explores relations between multiple factors

Project contains:
* ```titanic-data.csv``` -- analyzed dataset
* ```Project2.ipynb``` -- python notebook with performed analysis
* ```Project2.html``` -- project html report
